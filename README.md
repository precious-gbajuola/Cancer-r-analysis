# Cancer R Analysis: Gene Expression and Pathway Analysis in Multiple Myeloma

# Project Overview
This repository contains R scripts developed for the analysis and visualisation of cancer-related gene expression data, with a focus on understanding molecular mechanisms underlying haematological malignancies, particularly multiple myeloma. The analyses were designed to explore transcriptional changes associated with cell cycle regulation, immune modulation, and invasive signalling pathways, supporting hypothesis-driven experimental cancer research.

# Biological Context
Cancer progression is driven by dysregulated molecular signalling and tumour–immune interactions. This project applies computational analysis to investigate gene expression patterns relevant to tumour proliferation, immune modulation, and disease aggressiveness. The work complements experimental (wet-lab) research by providing data-driven insights into pathway-level alterations relevant to translational cancer biology.

# Data Description
- Input data consist of processed gene expression datasets (e.g., normalised expression matrices).
- Data are derived from anonymised experimental outputs or publicly available sources and are used strictly for research and training purposes.
- No patient-identifiable or sensitive clinical information is included.

# Methods and Analysis
The analysis workflow includes:
- Data filteration and normalization 
- Differential Gene Expression Analysis
- Enrichment pathway analysis and gene ontology
- Data visualisation using R
- Biological interpretation of pathways associated with proliferation, immune modulation, and invasiveness

All scripts are written to support clarity, reproducibility, and transparency.

# Software Requirements
- R (version ≥ 4.0 recommended)
- R packages commonly used include:
  - tidyverse
  - ggplot2
  - dplyr
  - limma / DESeq2 (where applicable)
  - edgeR
  - clusterProfiler

# How to Run the Analysis
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/precious-gbajuola/Cancer-r-analysis.git
2. Open R or RStudio.
3. Install required packages if not already installed.
4. Run the scripts in the order indicated by file names or internal comments.
5. Generated figures and outputs will be saved within the working directory or designated output folders.

# Outputs
- Publication-quality plots and data visualisations
- Summaries of gene expression patterns
- Annotated and reproducible R analysis scripts

These outputs were used to support internal laboratory reports and oral and written scientific presentations.
# Relevance
This repository demonstrates my ability to integrate computational data analysis with experimental cancer biology, reflecting skills relevant to interdisciplinary PhD training in tumour immunology, target profiling, and translational cancer research.
